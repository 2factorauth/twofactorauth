    <p>
        For <em>authentication</em>, Fidelity uses either a physical token provided by Fidelity
        or the Symantec VIP Access smartphone app.
        <br>
        Fidelity only offers 2FA on certain account types. For example, they
        do not support it for institutional retirement accounts of the kind
        that might be set up through an employer.
        <br>
        It appears there is no information about this service provided
        online and it must be enabled and managed by phone.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of October 2016, Fidelity also offers
      two-factor <em>authorization</em>, whereby customers may receive an authorization code
      before performing certain actions.

      According to <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/security/how-two-factor-authentication-works">Fidelity's documentation</a>:
    </p>
      <blockquote>
        You will get a security code to verify your identity when you perform highly
        sensitive transactions such as setting up new bankwire instructions or changing
        our contact information.
