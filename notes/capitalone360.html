                <p>
                    Capital One 360 protects accounts with self-selected
                    6-10 digit PIN.  PINs provide less protection than a
                    password or pass-phrase. This is especially notable
                    in the absence of two-factor authentication.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once a user is logged in they can create a new account.
                    The web page for new accounts includes a fully populated
                    form with personal information that includes name, address,
                    phone number, date of birth, and social security number.
                </p>

                <div class="ui info message">
                    <div class="header">
                        Note on security after account closure
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Even after a user closes all of their banking
                        accounts, their login will remain active.  The login
                        can not be deactivated by Capital One 360 support.
                        If the PIN for the closed account is ever compromised
                        the attacker will have access to personally identifying
                        information including the user's social security
                        number through the new account creation process
                        outlined above.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the social security number and other
                        information surfaced during account creation can
                        not be changed to invalid values by a user and
                        customer support is unable to change them as well.
