        When you login to your account on a new device using the
        desktop website, mobile website, or app, you will be
        prompted to receive a code through a SMS text message or 
        email on your account.

        <p>
            Multiple individuals are reporting that SwiftID was
            not working even after 30+ minute calls to technical
            support. Technical support further states that SwiftID
            is not always available. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The individual logging in has the ability to choose
            how to perform 2FA (SMS, email or SwiftID). If SwiftID
            cannot be enforced, is not always available and cannot
            be forced as the only option by the account holder,
            then there really is no security benefit to the 
            account holder.
