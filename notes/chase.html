        When you login to your account on a new device using the
        desktop website, mobile website, or app, you will be
        prompted to receive a code through a call or message to any
        registered phone number or email on your account.
    </p>

    <p>
        These phone numbers and emails are the ones registered on
        your main online account, NOT the ones registered for Chase
        QuickPay or banking over text message.
