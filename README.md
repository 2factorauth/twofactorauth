## The Goal

The goal is to build a website ([acceptBitcoin.Cash](https://acceptBitcoin.Cash)) with a comprehensive list of sites that accept or support Bitcoin Cash, as well as Bitcoin (Legacy).

Our hope is to connect consumers and merchants, while spreading awareness and promoting global adoption of [Bitcoin Cash (https://www.bitcoincash.org). 

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the list, please read the entire guidelines here in
[CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib].

## Running Locally

acceptBitcoin.Cash is built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [github-pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem.
In order to run the site locally, it is necessary to install bundler, install all dependencies, and then use Jekyll to serve
the site. If the `gem` command is not available to you, it is necessary to install Ruby with RubyGems.
Once Ruby and RubyGems are installed and available from the command line, acceptBitcoin.Cash can be setup using the following commands.

```
gem install bundler
cd ~/acceptbitcoincash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The acceptBitcoin.Cash website should then be accessible from `http://localhost:4000`.
