A list of popular sites and whether or not they accept authentication with USB dongles.

## The Goal

The goal is to have a website with a comprehensive list of sites that support
One Time Passwords (OTP) or Universal 2nd Factor (U2F).

This is to aid when deciding on alternative services based on the security they
offer for their customers.

This also is a way for consumers to see what sites still need to invest in
further security practices and which ones already do.
