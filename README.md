[2FA Directory][site_url] is an open-source project that aims to improve online security by providing a directory of websites and services that support two-factor authentication (2FA). Our community-driven platform allows anyone to contribute to the list, making it the most comprehensive directory of its kind.

We hope that this directory can help consumers decide between alternative services based on the security they offer their customers. This project also serves as an indicator of a site's general security efforts.

## Usage
