A list of popular sites and whether or not they accept two factor auth.

## The Goal

The goal is to have a website with a comprehensive list of sites that support
two factor auth as well as the methods that they support it.

This is to aid when deciding on alternative services based on the security they
offer for their customers.

This also is a way for consumers to see what sites still need to invest in
further security practices and which ones already do.
