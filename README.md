A list of popular sites and whether or not they support two factor authentication.

## The Goal :goal_net:

The goal of this project is to build a website ([2fa.directory][site_url]) with a list of popular sites that support
two factor authentication, as well as the methods that they provide.

Our hope is to aid consumers who are deciding between alternative services based on the security they
offer for their customers. This project also serves as an indicator of general security efforts used on a site.
