        Our site depends on user contributions to stay up to date. If you know how to write JSON files we prefer you create a [pull request](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) instead of an issue.

        Please take time to fill out as much as possible in this form. We receive a lot of issues and your thoroughness helps speed things up.
        If you're not able to fill a field out, leave it blank and let us know why in the "Additional information" section.
